## About me :information_source:
I consider myself a person passionate about technology, especially programming and software development. Since my start, I have a clear goal; to be a professional who can bring an important value with my knowledge and my experience. I'm constantly learning and putting in practice that I learn it on projects and challenges. Some technologies that I can use are HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, among others.
